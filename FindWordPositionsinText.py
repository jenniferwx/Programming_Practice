'''
Given a text file and a word, find the positions that the word occurs in the file. Weâ€™ll be asked to find 
the positions of many words in the same file.

# Solution 1: construct hashtable O(N), O(1) for searching
import collections as col
import re  #Regular expression operations library

def getWords(text): 
    return re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]',' ',text.lower()).split()  
    # convert to lower letters and replace non-alphanumeric letter to space, finally split on whitespace

    index = col.defaultdict(list)
    words = getWords(text)
    for pos, word in enumerate(words):
        index[word].append(pos)
    return index

# Better Solution: Trie        
'''
it's very useful to use a trie while performing storage and retrieval on text data
