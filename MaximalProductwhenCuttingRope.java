/**
* Given a rope with length n, how to cut the rope into m parts with length n[0], n[1], ..., n[m-1], in order to get 
* the maximal product of n[0]*n[1]* ... *n[m-1]? We have to cut once at least. 
* Additionally, the length of the whole length of the rope, as well as the length of each part, are in integer value.

* For example, if the length of the rope is 8, the maximal product of the part lengths is 18. In order to get the
* maximal product, the rope is cut into three parts with lengths 2, 3, and 3 respectively
