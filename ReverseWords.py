'''
Given an input string, reverse all the words. 
To clarify, input: “Interviews are awesome!” 
output: “awesome! are Interviews”. 

Consider all consecutive non-whitespace characters as individual words. If there are multiple spaces between words 
reduce them to a single white space. Also remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. 
So, the output for ”   CS degree”, “CS    degree”, “CS degree   “, or ”   CS   degree   ” are all the same: “degree CS”
